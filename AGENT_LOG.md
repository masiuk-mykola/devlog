# AGENT_LOG

Honest log of how this project was built with Claude Code. Newest entry on top.

## 2026-05-26 — Task 2: shadcn/ui

- shadcn CLI generated everything in `components/ui/` (button, input, textarea, label, select, badge, sheet, dialog, dropdown-menu, tabs, card, sonner, separator, scroll-area, skeleton, tooltip). None of those files are hand-edited.
- Mounted `<Toaster richColors position="top-right" />` in `app/layout.tsx` by hand — the only manual edit in this task.
- shadcn auto-injected its CSS variables into `app/globals.css`; left them untouched.

## 2026-05-26 — Task 1: Bootstrap

- Claude scaffolded the Next.js 15 project via `create-next-app` (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, Turbopack).
- Claude added runtime deps (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `better-sqlite3`, `nanoid`, `zod`) and dev deps (`vitest`, `tsx`).
- Marked `better-sqlite3` as `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.ts` because Turbopack otherwise tries to bundle the native binary.
- Spec + plan written by Claude through the brainstorming → writing-plans workflow before any code touched the repo.
